The "Blockchain-Based Access Model for Student Academic Records with Authentication" project aims to create a secure, decentralized system for managing and verifying student academic records. Utilizing blockchain technology ensures the integrity, immutability, and transparency of the records, while an authentication mechanism guarantees that only authorized users can access sensitive information.

The system consists of four main functionalities:

Signup: Users, either students or institutional representatives, can register on the platform by providing necessary details. This information is securely stored and used to manage access control.

Institutional Login: Academic institutions can log in to the system to issue, manage, and verify academic records. Authentication ensures that only legitimate institutions can perform these actions.

Student Login: Students can log in to view their academic records. Authentication protects student privacy and ensures that only the respective student can access their data.

Access Request: Authorized users, such as potential employers or academic institutions, can request access to a student's academic records. The system manages these requests, ensuring compliance with privacy policies and user consent.

The project leverages front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript for creating user-friendly interfaces. Flask, a lightweight Python web framework, is used for the backend to handle server-side logic and integrate with the blockchain. Solidity smart contracts are deployed on the blockchain to handle record issuance and verification, ensuring data integrity and decentralization.

Overall, this project provides a robust solution for managing academic records, enhancing security, privacy, and trust in the academic verification process.
